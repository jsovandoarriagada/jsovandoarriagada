Hello, my name is JosÃ© SimÃ³n Ovando Arriagada!

I am a sociable, proactive, organized, persevering and curious person. I enjoy studying and learning new technologies.

In 2022 I studied Frontend React Development at Coderhouse, finishing in the Top 10 of best students in the 3 courses that comprise it. In 2023 I completed the ONE program from Oracle and Alura Latam, and started working as a Freelance Web Developer, developing as my first job a landing page for the "Festival de Artes Verbales Barrabase", a unique event that fuses rap with written battles and freestyle, whose first edition took place on January 21, 2024, in Santiago, Chile.

I am currently focused on studying React, UI Design and Figma, self-taught.
